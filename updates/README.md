## UI/UX Changes

### Sidebar Changes
- Moved from right side to left side
- Width reduced from 64px to 32px
- CSV Upload button highlighting fixed to properly show light blue when active
- Navigation links and profile icon maintained in the same order

### Scrolling Behavior
- Scrolling is now contained within the main content area only
- Top panel and sidebar remain fixed in place when scrolling
- This provides a more app-like experience with static navigation elements

### Footer Removal
- The blue footer has been completely removed
- This creates a cleaner, more modern interface

## Testing Instructions

1. **Layout Verification**:
   - Verify that the sidebar appears on the left side of the screen
   - Confirm the sidebar width is approximately half of its previous size
   - Check that all navigation text fits properly within the sidebar

2. **Navigation Testing**:
   - Test each navigation link to ensure it routes to the correct page
   - Verify the CSV Upload button properly highlights in light blue when active
   - Test the profile icon dropdown functionality

3. **Scroll Behavior**:
   - Add enough content to cause scrolling
   - Verify that only the main content area scrolls
   - Confirm the top panel and sidebar remain fixed in place

4. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - Test the layout on different screen sizes to ensure proper responsiveness
   - Verify the sidebar text remains readable on smaller screens
