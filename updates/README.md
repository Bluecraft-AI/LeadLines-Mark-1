# LeadLines AI Agent UI Update v12

This update refines the AI Agent chatbot interface by eliminating gaps between the banners and container edges, ensuring a seamless scrolling experience.

## 🛠️ Changes Made

1. **Eliminated Banner Gaps**:
   - Removed spaces between the top banner and parent container blue banner
   - Removed spaces between the bottom banner and the bottom of the window/screen
   - Prevented messages from being visible in gap areas when scrolling

2. **Improved Banner Integration**:
   - Used negative margins and compensating padding to extend banners fully
   - Added scroll padding to prevent content from being hidden under sticky elements
   - Maintained transparent look with no shadows or borders

3. **Enhanced Scroll Experience**:
   - Maintained conditional scrollbar visibility that only appears when content overflows
   - Added proper scroll padding to ensure content is never hidden under banners
   - Improved the overall visual flow when scrolling through messages
