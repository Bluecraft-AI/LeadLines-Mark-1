# Firebase-Supabase Integration PR

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive integration between Firebase Authentication and Supabase to ensure consistent user identification across all platform features. The integration solves the challenge of different user ID formats between Firebase and Supabase by providing a mapping solution that maintains compatibility with both systems.

## Changes

- **Created `auth_mapping` Table**: Added a SQL migration script to create a new table that maps Firebase UIDs to Supabase UUIDs
- **Added Helper Functions**: Implemented SQL functions for mapping between Firebase UIDs and Supabase UUIDs
- **Updated RLS Policies**: Modified Row Level Security policies to work seamlessly with Firebase authentication
- **Refactored Service Files**:
  - Updated `AssistantService.js` to use the Supabase UUID mapping functions
  - Maintained `SubmissionsService.js` to use Firebase UIDs directly for backward compatibility
- **Added Implementation Tools**:
  - `IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Detailed implementation guide
  - `run-sql-migration.sh`: Script to display and run the SQL migration
  - `implement-integration.sh`: Script to automate the implementation process
  - `test-integration.js`: Browser-based test script to verify integration

## Why This Matters

The Firebase-Supabase Integration allows us to:

1. Maintain a consistent user identification system across all features
2. Ensure proper Row Level Security in Supabase with Firebase authentication
3. Support both UUID and string-based user IDs in different tables
4. Simplify future development by providing clear mapping functions

## Implementation Steps

For users who need to implement this update, we've provided automated tools:

1. Run `./implement-integration.sh` to backup and replace service files
2. Execute the SQL migration script in Supabase's SQL Editor
3. Test the integration using `test-integration.js` in the browser console

## Testing Done

- Successfully created and tested the `auth_mapping` table
- Verified mapping functions work correctly
- Tested the updated `AssistantService.js` with the new Supabase UUID mapping
- Confirmed `SubmissionsService.js` continues to work with Firebase UIDs
- Validated that RLS policies correctly enforce user-based access control

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Existing users might have inconsistent IDs
  - **Mitigation**: The SQL script handles creating mappings for existing users
  
- **Risk**: Service disruption during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Implementation scripts create backups and provide testing tools

## Documentation

- Added `IMPLEMENTATION.md` with detailed steps
- Updated project README.md to mention the integration
- Included inline code documentation in service files
- Created SQL comments explaining the purpose of each migration component
